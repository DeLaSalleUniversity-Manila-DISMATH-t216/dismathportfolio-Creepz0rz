## Week 1
* Discrete mathematics (DISMATH) is a subject, used to arrive at a mathematical truth of a statement
* DISMATH uses logic symbols shown in this table:

| Logical Symbol  |  Logical Operator | Shorthand | Logical Expression |
| :-----: |:-------:|:-----:| :-------: |
| ¬ | Negation | NOT | ¬p |
| ∧ | Conjunction | AND | p ∧ q |
| v | Disjunction | OR | p v q |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | XOR| p ⊕ q  ≡ (¬p ∧ q) v (p ∧ ¬q) |
| → | Conditional | IF, THEN | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | IFF |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |

Notes:
* XOR
* Conditional
  * q is always true, or p must be also false
* Biconditional
  * p and q must be opposite


## Week 2
*Logical Equivalences, used for more complex logical statements

| Name  | Logical Equivalence |
| :-----: | :-------: |
| Identity | p v F ≡ p|
|   |  p ∧ T ≡ p  |
| Domination  | p v F ≡ p |
| ⊕ | Exclusive disjunction | 
| → | Conditional | IF, THEN | p → q ≡  ¬p v q |
| ↔ | Biconditional | IFF |  p ↔ q ≡ (p → q) ∧ (q → p) |
